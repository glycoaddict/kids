It's often hard to keep doing the right thing when
things are not going your way. When have you
been tempted to avoid trouble by sinning?

How does knowing that God has a plan, that
he is with you and that he is all powerful help
when you face problems?

At this point in the story, how much of Joseph's
dreams seem to be coming true?
