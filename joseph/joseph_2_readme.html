# Why did Potiphar like Joseph? (39:3-4) 

# Why was Joseph so successful? (39:3) 

# Potiphar's wife also liked Joseph. Why was this a problem? (39:9)

# Think about

In this difficult situation what did Joseph
do to make sure that he didn't sin? (39:10)

What happened because he chose
not to sin? (39:19-20)

How would things maybe have been easier
if he did what Potiphar's wife wanted?


# Discuss
It's often hard to keep doing the right thing when
things are not going your way. When have you
been tempted to avoid trouble by sinning?

How does knowing that God has a plan, that
he is with you and that he is all powerful help
when you face problems?

At this point in the story, how much of Joseph's
dreams seem to be coming true?
