Read Mark 10:13-31 in parts, stopping to pose comprehension questions thus:

Start by explaining that Jesus was very popular and many people were coming to see him. They loved to listen to what he had to say. There were old people, young people, rich people and poor people. The disciples knew that Jesus was very busy and that many people wanted to be near him, but they couldn’t all be near him. In today’s true story some children and a rich man came to see Jesus. Which do you think the disciples would allow to take up Jesus’ time, the children or the rich and important man?

Read the story of the little children as three groups.

Q: Do you think Jesus would prefer someone who was rich, obeyed all the rules, who everyone thought was great, or someone who was poor, weak in the eyes of men, but willing to love Jesus above all else?

Explain a camel and a needle.

Read the story of the rich young ruler, Mark 10:17-22, as three groups.
