All creatures of our God and King,  
Lift up your voice and with us sing,  
Alleluia! Alleluia!  
Thou burning sun with golden beam,  
Thou silver moon with softer gleam!  

***Chorus:***
*O praise Him! O praise Him!  
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!*  

Thou rushing wind that art so strong,  
Ye clouds that sail in heavâ€™n along,  
O praise Him! Alleluia!  
Thou rising moon, in praise rejoice,  
Ye lights of evening, find a voice!  

*to Chorus*

And all ye men of tender heart,  
Forgiving others, take your part,  
O praise Him! Alleluia!  
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,  
Praise God and on Him cast your care!  

*to Chorus*

Let all things their Creator bless,  
And worship Him in humbleness,  
O praise Him! Alleluia!  
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,  
And praise the Spirit, Three in One!  

*to Chorus*
