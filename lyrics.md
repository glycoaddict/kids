All creatures of our God and King  
Lift up your voice and with us sing,  
Alleluia! Alleluia!  
Thou burning sun with golden beam,  
Thou silver moon with softer gleam!  

***Chorus:***

*O praise Him! O praise Him!  
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!*  

Thou rushing wind that art so strong,  
Ye clouds that sail in heavâ€™n along,  
O praise Him! Alleluia!  
Thou rising moon, in praise rejoice,  
Ye lights of evening, find a voice!  

***Chorus:***

*O praise Him! O praise Him!  
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!*  
 
And all ye men of tender heart,  
Forgiving others, take your part,  
O praise Him! Alleluia!  
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,  
Praise God and on Him cast your care!  

***Chorus:***

*O praise Him! O praise Him!  
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!*  

Let all things their Creator bless,   
And worship Him in humbleness,  
O praise Him! Alleluia!  
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,  
And praise the Spirit, Three in One!  

***Chorus:***

*O praise Him! O praise Him!  
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!*  
      
  
# [Crown Him With Many Crowns](https://youtu.be/nG_sMsWFk0U)

1  
Crown him with many crowns,  
the Lamb upon his throne.  
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns  
all music but its own.  
Awake, my soul, and sing  
of him who died for thee,  
and hail him as thy matchless king  
through all eternity.  

2  
Crown him the Son of God,  
before the worlds began;  
let all who tread where he has trod,  
crown him the Son of Man,  
who every grief has known  
that wrings the human breast,  
and takes and bears them for his own,  
that all in him may rest.  

3  
Crown him the Lord of life,  
who triumphed o'er the grave,  
and rose victorious in the strife  
for those he came to save.  
His glories now we sing  
who died and rose on high,  
who died eternal life to bring,  
and lives that death may die.  

4  
Crown Him the Lord of Heaven,  
enthroned in worlds above,  
Crown Him the King to Whom is giv'n  
the wondrous name of Love.  
Crown Him with many crowns,  
as thrones before Him fall;  
Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns,  
for He is King of all.
